<h1>Translation: general remarks</h1>





<p>"We" refers below to the OmegaT project team. The OmegaT project team
is not a company or formal legal body; just a group of volunteers
involved in the OmegaT project.</p>





<p>OmegaT is a free, open-source translation memory program. The user
interface and documentation were originally written in English. As the
program is intended for translators throughout the world and not just
in English-speaking countries, it is appropriate that the documentation
(and, if possible, the program itself) be available in other languages.
However, as the program is being given away and not sold commercially,
there are
no resources available to pay for translations. Instead, those involved
in the OmegaT project hope that translations will be provided first and
foremost by translators who have tried OmegaT and are convinced of its
value to
the translation community as a whole.</p>





<h1>The translation work</h1>






<p>At the time of writing, the material to be translated comprises:<br>





</p>



<ul>




  <li>The user interface (menus etc.)</li>




  <li>The user manual (very comprehensive)</li>




  <li>The "instant start" guide (a short introduction to using OmegaT)</li>




  <li>The readme file (a document that contains general information about OmegaT)</li>




  <li>The OmegaT web pages (probably where you are reading this)</li>




</ul>




<p></p>





<p>Translators are free to tackle as much or as little of the work as they
wish. In particular, the main user manual is likely to take two weeks
to translate, and several translators may wish to share the work.</p>





<h1>Procedure</h1>






<ol style="">




  <li>
    
    
    
    <p>Contact the localization co-ordinator at
info@omegat.org, who will be able to tell you of any
specific issues regarding your language.</p>




  </li>





  <li>
    
    
    
    <p>Join the OmegaT user group (also known as "OmT") at
    <a href="{{ site.data.links.support }}">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/omegat/</a>.
During the subscription process, you will have to send a short message
to the group moderators: this is to enable them to distinguish genuine
users from spammers.</p>





    
    
    
    <p>After joining, visit the OmegaT Localization Plan at
    <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/OmegaT/database?method=reportRows&amp;tbl=2">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/OmegaT/database &gt; OmegaT Localization
Plan</a>. This plan shows what translation/localization work has already
been done on OmegaT, and what work is currently in progress. If a
suitable piece of the work for your language has not yet been started,
you can make an entry in the plan to indicate that you have assumed
responsibility for it. The purpose of the plan is to prevent two or
more translators from working on the same translation without being
aware of it (duplication of effort).</p>




  </li>





  <li>
    
    
    
    <p>Although not essential, we recommend that you also join the OmegaT
localizers' mailing list (also known as "OmT-l10n") at
    <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/omegat-l10n">https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/omegat-l10n</a>.</p>




  </li>






  <li>
    
    
    
    <p>Download the files for translation. The localization files of the
OmegaT program itself can be downloaded from
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=68187">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=68187</a>. Select "Download"
for the package "Other - L10N projects". You will be offered a choice
of two packages for download,&nbsp;"Full" and "Minimal".</p>





    
    
    
    <p>The full
package contains the user manual, the instant start manual, the user
interface resource bundle and the readme file. The minimal package
contains the same files as the full package, except for the main user
manual. You do not have to translate a complete package; you can, for
instance, translate just the user interface (Bundle.properties), or
just the instant start tutorial.</p>





    
    
    
    <p>If you wish to translate the OmegaT web pages, please contact the localization co-ordinator (see above).</p>




  </li>





  <li>
    
    
    
    <p>There may be older versions of the documentation and/or translation
memories (TMX files) available for your language which are useful to
your translation. A repository has been created on the OmT group under
Files &gt; 6-Localizations, but it is also worth asking on the
localizers' list (OmT-l10n) whether anyone has any reference material
which might facilitate your translation.</p>




  </li>





  <li>
    
    
    
    <p>Translate the files you have chosen. Needless to say, we would
prefer you to use OmegaT for the OmegaT localization work. You can
however use other software if you wish.</p>





    
    
    
    <p>Unpack the zip archives of the full or minimal package you have
downloaded. When unpacked, the files are a ready-to-use OmegaT project.
You do not need to create an OmegaT project as you normally would.</p>





    
    
    
    <p>You have complete freedom in how you translate. You can modify,
correct, add or delete information at your own discretion. If you have
any questions, the OmT-l10n list is the best place to post them.</p>





    
    
    
    <p>If the document you are translating contains it, please do <strong>not</strong>
translate the GPL (GNU Public License) or the GFDL (GNU Free
Documentation License). Firstly, only the original English is legally
valid. A translation
may also be provided for information, but it has no legal validity.
Secondly, unless yours is a <strong>very</strong>
uncommon language, both documents have in all probability already been
translated. Search the web and you&rsquo;ll probably find the
translations.</p>





    
    
    
    <p>Please keep translations of HTML files in HTML format. The HTML
formatting is retained automatically if you use OmegaT. We are grateful
for all translations, but it simplifies our work considerably if files
are returned in the same format (and not HTML file as Word files, for
example).</p>




  </li>





  <li>
    
    
    
    <p>After completing your translation, you can view the user manual,
instant start and web pages in any application capable of reading HTML
files, e.g. your web browser. The readme.txt file is simple plain-text
file that you can read in a text editor or word processor.</p>





    
    
    
    <p>The file "Bundle.properties" contains the strings for the user
interface. It is possible for localizers to test this file themselves,
but the procedure is somewhat complicated and we are in the process of
making it easier. If you are interested in testing your translation of
the user interface yourself, please contact the OmegaT team for details
of the procedure. You can however deliver the Bundle.properties file
untested.</p>




  </li>





  <li>
    
    
    
    <p>Deliver your file to the localization co-ordinator, who will
pass it
on to the development team for inclusion in the next release of OmegaT.
If you used OmegaT or another CAT tool for the work, please also send
your translation memory (TMX file) together with the translation. This
will greatly simplify updating of your translation in the future.&nbsp;</p>


  </li>






  <li>
    
    
    
    <p>Don't forget to update the OmegaT Localization Plan (see Step 2 of
the procedure) to show that you have completed translation of a
particular document/version. Equally, if you abandon the translation
work for any reason, please update your entry in the plan to show this.
This enables the document concerned to be released for translation by
another translator.</p>




  </li>




</ol>





<h1>How OmegaT handles localized versions</h1>






<p>At the time of writing (version 1.6.1), OmegaT detects the language of
the operating system you are using. It then loads the user interface
and/or user manual in that language, if available. If a user interface
or user manual are not available in the language of your operating
system, OmegaT defaults to displaying the English versions.</p>





<p>If OmegaT contains a language version which you would like to use but
is not the language of your operating system, you can force OmegaT to
use the desired version by changing the launch command. The launch
command can be found in the file "omegat" and/or "omegat.bat" in the
folder containing the program. The normal command is:</p>





<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar OmegaT.jar
</p>





<p>Change this by adding the user language option and the corresponding language code, e.g. in the following case for French:</p>





<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java -Duser.language=fr -jar OmegaT.jar</p>





<h1>Copyright issues</h1>






<p>Most of the OmegaT documentation is licensed for re-use under the GNU Public License (GPL) or GNU
Free Documentation License (GFDL). The web pages are not licensed for
re-use. None of this need concern you unless you are particularly
interested in copyright issues.</p>





<p>By delivering a translation of any part of the OmegaT documentation
to
the OmegaT project, you authorize the OmegaT project (defined as the
project owner) to reuse it within the context of the OmegaT project.
You will&nbsp;be credited as the author of your work and named as joint
copyright holder.&nbsp;</p>
